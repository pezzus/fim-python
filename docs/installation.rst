Installation
=====================================

The only prerequisite before installing is cython to compile some of the files

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cython

All remaining dependencies should be installed directly using pip.
To install, either clone the repository and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/thomgrand/fim-python .
    pip install -e .[gpu]


or simply via pip 

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install fimpy[gpu]
